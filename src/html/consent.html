            <h2>COOKIE POLICY</h2>
            <p>This Cookie Policy explains how {{brand}} ("Company," "we," "us," and "our") uses cookies and similar technologies to recognize you when you visit our website at {{website}} ("Website"). It explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.</p>
            <p>In some cases we may use cookies to collect personal information, or that becomes personal information if we combine it with other information.</p>
            <h3>What are cookies?</h3>
            <p>Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by website owners in order to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.</p>
            <p>Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, {{brand}}) are called "first-party cookies." Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called "third-party cookies." Third-party cookies enable third-party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g., advertising, interactive content, and analytics). The parties that set these third-party cookies can recognize your computer both when it visits the website in question and also when it visits certain other websites.</p>
            <h3>Why do we use cookies?</h3>
            <p>We use first- and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Website to operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies. Other cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Online Properties. Third parties serve cookies through our Website for advertising, analytics, and other purposes. This is described in more detail below.</p>
            <h3>How can I control cookies?</h3>
            <p>You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You can exercise your cookie rights by setting your preferences in the Cookie Consent Manager. The Cookie Consent Manager allows you to select which categories of cookies you accept or reject. Essential cookies cannot be rejected as they are strictly necessary to provide you with services.</p>
            <p>The Cookie Consent Manager can be found in the notification banner and on our website. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our website though your access to some functionality and areas of our website may be restricted. You may also set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies.</p>
            <p>The specific types of first- and third-party cookies served through our Website and the purposes they perform are described in the table below (please note that the specific cookies served may vary depending on the specific Online Properties you visit):</p>
            <h4>Essential website cookies</h4>
            <p>These cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with services available through our Website and to use some of its features, such as access to secure areas.</p>
            <h4>Performance and functionality cookies</h4>
            <p>These cookies are used to enhance the performance and functionality of our Website but are non-essential to their use. However, without these cookies, certain functionality (like videos) may become unavailable.</p>
            <h4>Analytics and customization cookies</h4>
            <p>These cookies collect information that is used either in aggregate form to help us understand how our Website is being used or how effective our marketing campaigns are, or to help us customize our Website for you.</p>
            <h4>Advertising cookies</h4>
            <p>These cookies are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you. They perform functions like preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly displayed for advertisers, and in some cases selecting advertisements that are based on your interests.</p>
            <h4>Unclassified cookies</h4>
            <p>These are cookies that have not yet been categorized. We are in the process of classifying these cookies with the help of their providers.</p>
            <h3>Do you serve targeted advertising?</h3>
            <p>Third parties may serve cookies on your computer or mobile device to serve advertising through our Website. These companies may use information about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide relevant advertisements about goods and services that you may be interested in. They may also employ technology that is used to measure the effectiveness of advertisements. They can accomplish this by using cookies or web beacons to collect information about your visits to this and other sites in order to provide relevant advertisements about goods and services of potential interest to you. The information collected through this process does not enable us or them to identify your name, contact details, or other details that directly identify you unless you choose to provide these.</p>
